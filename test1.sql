Ok thank you!
 
Thank you Mark, resources will be great.
 
Hi mark, I'm just leaving the meeting & will rejoin on my personal device, I'm now getting information in my terminal when on personal device so looks like code space is going to work on that 
 
Jess Thomson  (Unverified) was invited to the meeting.

 
Iâ€™ve joined on my personal device but now nothing in teams chat, it says muted so work laptop best option I think if IT can unblock the website
